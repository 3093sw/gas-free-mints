# gas-free-mints 
This project leverages OpenGSN (Gasless Send Network) to enable users to mint NFTs or perform other blockchain transactions without paying gas fees. Instead, a third party, known as the "gas sponsor," covers the gas fees on behalf of the users, an important piece in making the blockchain more accesible and widespread.

Using OpenGSN to relay calls. This could be extended to send any transaction but have someone else pay the gas. e.g when onboarding new users, pay for their first five transactions. This was featured in the OpenGSN community as a tutorial.

# Example Use Cases:

NFT Minting and Distribution:

- Marketing campaigns: Companies can sponsor gas fees for a limited number of NFT mints, allowing users to claim free NFTs as part of a promotional campaign or event.
- Airdrops: Projects can airdrop NFTs to their community members or early adopters without requiring them to pay gas fees.
- First-time user experience: Dapps or platforms can sponsor the first few transactions for new users, providing a seamless onboarding experience without the initial barrier of gas fees.
